# Reviewer Independence Rule

## The rule

**REVIEWER ≠ GENERATOR**

The AI model (or tool) that reviews code must be **different** from the AI model that generated the code.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  REVIEWER ≠ GENERATOR                                   │
│                                                         │
│  WHY: Same AI makes same mistakes twice                │
│       Same blind spots → Same bugs missed              │
│                                                         │
│  Code by Claude  → Review by Copilot/Cursor           │
│  Code by Copilot → Review by Claude/Antigravity       │
│  Code by Cursor  → Review by Claude/Copilot           │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

## What to record in the PR

Use this snippet in the PR description:

```markdown
## AI Tool Chain
- Generated by: _________
- Reviewed by: _________, _________
```

---

## Review checklist (minimum)

A reviewer model should check against:
- constitution constraints
- acceptance criteria
- security risks
- performance risks
- missing test cases
- “looks right but wrong” edge cases

---

## If independence isn’t possible

If you cannot access a different model/tool:
- ask for a **human reviewer**, and
- run at least **two automated tools** (lint + static analysis/code quality), and
- document the limitation in the PR.
