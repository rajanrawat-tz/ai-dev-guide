# Role Guide: Tech Lead

## Your focus
Make the process adoptable and enforceable, without slowing delivery unnecessarily.

## Where you engage
- Phase 0–1: ensure teams are producing good artifacts (spec/plan/tasks)
- Phase 2: ensure work is tracked properly
- Phase 4–5: ensure review quality and safe release

## Responsibilities
- Own the SOP in practice (help your org customize it correctly)
- Approve exceptions (coverage, compliance, tool limitations)
- Ensure juniors get unblocked quickly
- Track adoption/quality metrics

## Team adoption checklist
- [ ] Everyone knows where the constitution is
- [ ] Everyone understands TDD gate + coverage target
- [ ] Reviewer independence is happening consistently
- [ ] Default toolchain is available in IDE/CI

## What you should audit in PRs
- [ ] Spec and acceptance criteria are linked
- [ ] Tests were written first (evidence via commits or workflow)
- [ ] Coverage >= 80%
- [ ] Independent model review documented
- [ ] Automated tools ran (lint + at least one more)
- [ ] Docs/quickstart updated when relevant
