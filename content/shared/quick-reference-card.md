## Phase 0: Creating Foundation Documents

### From PRD to Feature Specification
```
PRD → Analyze Features → Define Stories → Write Acceptance Criteria → Feature Specification.md
```

### From Feature Specification to Implementation Guide
```
Feature Specification → Research Patterns → Design Abstractions → Code Examples → Implementation Guide.md
```

---

## Speckit Commands

| Command | When to Use | Junior-Friendly? |
|---------|-------------|------------------|
| `/speckit.constitution` | Create/update project rules | ⚠️ Advanced (ask senior) |
| `/speckit.specify` | Generate feature spec from story | ✅ **Start here** |
| `/speckit.clarify` | Ask clarifying questions about spec | ✅ **Use liberally** |
| `/speckit.plan` | Create implementation plan | ✅ After spec done |
| `/speckit.tasks` | Generate task breakdown | ✅ After plan approved |
| `/speckit.analyze` | Cross-check spec/plan/tasks | ✅ Before Phase 2 |
| `/speckit.checklist` | Generate requirements checklist | ✅ Optional validation |
| `/speckit.implement` | Execute implementation | ⚠️ Rarely used |
| `/speckit.taskstoissues` | Convert tasks to GitHub issues | ✅ Start of Phase 2 |

**No Speckit access?** Use manual templates in your project's templates directory and get senior review before implementing.

## Development Flow (5 Phases)

```
Phase 0         Phase 1          Phase 2              Phase 3          Phase 4
Foundation  →   Speckit      →   GitHub           →   Implement    →   Multi-Model
(PRD→FS→IG)     Artifacts        Issues (Hierarchy)   + TDD            Review

⏱️ 30-60m      ⏱️ 45-90m        ⏱️ 15m              ⏱️ 4-8h          ⏱️ 1-2h

                                 Epic → US → Tasks
```

**First feature**: ~12 hours total | **After 5 features**: ~6 hours total

**Note**: FS = Feature Specification, IG = Implementation Guide

---

## Core Documents

| Doc | Typical Location | Use For | Can I Skip? |
|-----|----------|---------|-------------|
| **PRD** | Project-specific | Requirements from stakeholders | ❌ Never |
| **Feature Specification** | Project root or docs/ | User stories, acceptance criteria | ❌ Never |
| **Implementation Guide** | Project root or docs/ | Patterns & code examples | After 5 features |
| **Constitution** | Project-specific (varies) | Technical constraints | ❌ Never |

**Note**: Ask your team lead for exact document locations in your project.

## REVIEWER INDEPENDENCE RULE ⚠️

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  CRITICAL: REVIEWER ≠ GENERATOR                         │
│                                                         │
│  WHY: Same AI makes same mistakes twice                │
│       Same blind spots → Same bugs missed              │
│                                                         │
│  Code by Claude  → Review by Copilot/Cursor           │
│  Code by Copilot → Review by Claude/Antigravity       │
│  Code by Cursor  → Review by Claude/Copilot           │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Track your chain in PR description:**
```markdown
## AI Tool Chain
- Generated by: _________
- Reviewed by: _________, _________
```

**Why this matters**: Same AI has same blind spots. Different models catch 40% more bugs.

---

## AI Review Tools by Experience Level

### Month 1-2 (Start Simple)
**Use These:**
- ✅ **One AI coding assistant** (pick Claude OR Copilot)
- ✅ **ESLint/Prettier** (style & standards)
- ✅ **Different AI for review** (if Claude codes, Copilot reviews)

### Month 3-6 (Add Static Analysis)
**Add These:**
- ✅ **Sourcery** - Automated code quality
- ✅ **SonarLint** - Bug detection
- ✅ Keep using different AI for reviews

### Month 6+ (Full Toolkit)
**Add Advanced:**
- ✅ **Antigravity** - Architecture & security
- ✅ **CodeRabbit** - Auto PR review
- ✅ **SonarQube** - Full project analysis

### Tool Comparison

| Tool | Type | Best For | When to Use |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| **Sourcery** | Static | Code quality, refactoring | Every PR |
| **ESLint** | Static | Style, standards | Every commit |
| **Antigravity** | AI | Architecture, security | Complex features |
| **Claude** | LLM | Deep analysis, constitution | Code generation & review |
| **Copilot** | LLM | Quick fixes, inline help | Code generation & review |
| **Cursor** | LLM IDE | Full-file review, editing | Code generation & review |
| **CodeRabbit** | AI | PR auto-review | Every PR (if installed) |
| **SonarQube** | Static | Bugs, vulnerabilities, debt | Weekly/release |
| **DeepSource** | Static | Multi-language, auto-fix | CI pipeline |

## TDD Workflow (MANDATORY) 🔴

```
1. WRITE TEST → 2. RUN (FAIL) → 3. IMPLEMENT → 4. RUN (PASS) → 5. REFACTOR
     ⛔ RED                              ✅ GREEN            ♻️ CLEAN
```

**NEVER write implementation before test!**

**Why TDD is mandatory:**
- ✅ AI code has hidden edge cases
- ✅ Tests prove code works before PR
- ✅ Prevents 80% of production bugs
- ✅ Refactoring is safe with test coverage

**Coverage requirement**: >= 80% (no exceptions)

---

## Constitution Quick Check

**Before implementing, verify against YOUR constitution:**

This is a template - your project's constitution will have specific technical principles.

**Example areas your constitution should cover:**
1. ✅ **Stack**: Your approved tech stack and versions
2. ✅ **Architecture**: Your patterns (microservices, monolith, etc.)
3. ✅ **TDD**: Tests FIRST, coverage minimum
4. ✅ **Data Handling**: Data retention, privacy, compliance
5. ✅ **Persistence**: Database strategy, caching approach
6. ✅ **APIs/Messaging**: REST/GraphQL/event patterns
7. ✅ **Config**: Configuration management approach
8. ✅ **Containers**: Docker/Kubernetes requirements
9. ✅ **Testing**: Unit, integration, e2e requirements
10. ✅ **Observability**: Logging, metrics, monitoring

**Don't memorize** - Check your constitution document every feature.  
**Path varies by project** - Ask your team lead for location.

## Common Prompts (Copy-Paste Ready)

### Research Phase
```
"Analyze the codebase for [feature] and create a pre-implementation document that covers:
- Related existing code
- Files to modify
- Technical decisions needed
- Risks and dependencies"
```

### Start New Feature
```
"I'm starting [STORY-ID]. Read constitution, implementation guide, feature specification.
Perform pre-implementation analysis and identify:
1. Files to create/modify
2. Dependencies
3. Technical decisions needed"
```

### TDD Implementation
```
"Implement [task] following TDD:
1. Write test FIRST at [test file path]
2. Show me test code
3. Run it (should FAIL/RED)
4. Implement code to make it pass
5. Refactor while keeping GREEN"
```

### Code Review (Different Model)
```
"Review this code (generated by [MODEL]):

Constitution: [paste relevant sections]
Spec: [paste acceptance criteria]

Check for:
1. Constitution violations
2. Security issues
3. Performance problems
4. Missing error handling
5. Edge cases not tested"
```

## Common Situations & Quick Actions

| Situation | Quick Action |
|-----------|--------------|
| 🐛 **Bug in production** | Create issue → Write failing test → Fix → PR |
| ❓ **Spec unclear** | `/speckit.clarify` → Update spec → Get confirmation |
| 🚫 **Constitution blocks approach** | Document → Discuss with lead → ADR if needed |
| 🤔 **AI code looks wrong** | **Trust your instincts** → Check constitution → Different AI review → Ask senior |
| 💤 **Speckit down** | Use templates → Manual spec → Senior review before Phase 2 |
| ⏰ **Tests take too long** | **Don't skip** → Start with critical path → Add edge cases incrementally |
| 🚧 **Blocked by dependency** | Update issue → Work on parallel tasks → Create mocks for testing |
| 🌙 **Working after hours** | Check constitution → Use `/speckit.clarify` (async) → Post in team chat → Document blockers |

---

## Emergency Stops ⛔

**STOP IMMEDIATELY IF:**
- ❌ Constitution check fails → Escalate to tech lead
- ❌ Can't write test first → Requirements unclear, `/speckit.clarify`
- ❌ Security issue found → Fix before proceeding
- ❌ Coverage < 80% → Write more tests
- ❌ Same AI reviewing its own code → Use different model
- ❌ Docker tests fail → Debug before PR

**ESCALATE TO:**
- Tech lead for architecture decisions
- Create ADR if constitution change needed
- Senior developer if stuck > 2 hours
