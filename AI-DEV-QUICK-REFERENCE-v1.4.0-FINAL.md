## 📝 Phase 0: Creating Foundation Documents

### From PRD to Feature Specification
```
PRD → Analyze Features → Define Stories → Write Acceptance Criteria → Feature Specification.md
```

### From Feature Specification to Implementation Guide
```
Feature Specification → Research Patterns → Design Abstractions → Code Examples → Implementation Guide.md
```

## 🛠️ Speckit Commands

| Command | When to Use | Junior-Friendly? |
|---------|-------------|------------------|
| `/speckit.constitution` | Create/update project rules | Advanced (ask senior) |
| `/speckit.specify` | Generate feature spec from story | **Start here** |
| `/speckit.clarify` | Ask clarifying questions about spec | **Use liberally** |
| `/speckit.plan` | Create implementation plan | After spec done |
| `/speckit.tasks` | Generate task breakdown | After plan approved |
| `/speckit.analyze` | Cross-check spec/plan/tasks | Before Phase 2 |
| `/speckit.checklist` | Generate requirements checklist | Optional validation |
| `/speckit.implement` | Execute implementation | Rarely used |
| `/speckit.taskstoissues` | Convert tasks to GitHub issues | Start of Phase 2 |

**No Speckit access?** Use manual templates in your project's templates directory and get senior review before implementing.

## 🔄 Development Flow (5 Phases)

```
Phase 0         Phase 1          Phase 2              Phase 3          Phase 4
Foundation  →   Speckit      →   GitHub           →   Implement    →   Multi-Model
(PRD→FS→IG)     Artifacts        Issues (Hierarchy)   + TDD            Review

⏱️ 30-60m      ⏱️ 45-90m        ⏱️ 15m              ⏱️ 4-8h          ⏱️ 1-2h

                                 Epic → US → Tasks
```

**First feature**: ~12 hours total | **After 5 features**: ~6 hours total

**Note**: FS = Feature Specification, IG = Implementation Guide

## 📚 Core Documents

| Doc | Typical Location | Use For | Can I Skip? |
|-----|----------|---------|-------------|
| **PRD** | Project-specific | Requirements from stakeholders | Never |
| **Feature Specification** | Project root or docs/ | User stories, acceptance criteria | Never |
| **Implementation Guide** | Project root or docs/ | Patterns & code examples | After 5 features |
| **Constitution** | Project-specific (varies) | Technical constraints | Never |

**Note**: Ask your team lead for exact document locations in your project.

## ⚠️ REVIEWER INDEPENDENCE RULE

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  CRITICAL: REVIEWER ≠ GENERATOR                         │
│                                                         │
│  WHY: Same AI makes same mistakes twice                │
│       Same blind spots → Same bugs missed              │
│                                                         │
│  Code by Claude  → Review by Copilot/Cursor           │
│  Code by Copilot → Review by Claude/Antigravity       │
│  Code by Cursor  → Review by Claude/Copilot           │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

**Track your chain in PR description:**
```markdown
## AI Tool Chain
- Generated by: _________
- Reviewed by: _________, _________
```

**Why this matters**: Same AI has same blind spots. Different models catch 40% more bugs.

## 🤖 AI Review Tools by Experience Level

### Month 1-2 (Start Simple)
- One AI coding assistant (pick Claude OR Copilot)
- ESLint/Prettier (style & standards)
- Different AI for review (if Claude codes, Copilot reviews)

### Month 3-6 (Add Static Analysis)
- Sourcery - Automated code quality
- SonarLint - Bug detection
- Keep using different AI for reviews

### Month 6+ (Full Toolkit)
- Antigravity - Architecture & security
- CodeRabbit - Auto PR review
- SonarQube - Full project analysis

### Tool Comparison

| Tool | Type | Best For | When to Use |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| **Sourcery** | Static | Code quality, refactoring | Every PR |
| **ESLint** | Static | Style, standards | Every commit |
| **Antigravity** | AI | Architecture, security | Complex features |
| **Claude** | LLM | Deep analysis, constitution | Code generation & review |
| **Copilot** | LLM | Quick fixes, inline help | Code generation & review |
| **Cursor** | LLM IDE | Full-file review, editing | Code generation & review |

## 🧪 TDD Workflow (MANDATORY)

```
1. WRITE TEST → 2. RUN (FAIL) → 3. IMPLEMENT → 4. RUN (PASS) → 5. REFACTOR
     🔴 RED                           🟢 GREEN          ✨ CLEAN
```

**NEVER write implementation before test!**

**Why TDD is mandatory:**
- AI code has hidden edge cases
- Tests prove code works before PR
- Prevents 80% of production bugs
- Refactoring is safe with test coverage

**Coverage requirement**: >= 80% (no exceptions)

## 📜 Constitution Quick Check

**Before implementing, verify against YOUR constitution:**

This is a template - your project's constitution will have specific technical principles.

**Example areas your constitution should cover:**
1. **Stack**: Your approved tech stack and versions
2. **Architecture**: Your patterns (microservices, monolith, etc.)
3. **TDD**: Tests FIRST, coverage minimum
4. **Data Handling**: Data retention, privacy, compliance
5. **Persistence**: Database strategy, caching approach
6. **APIs/Messaging**: REST/GraphQL/event patterns
7. **Config**: Configuration management approach
8. **Containers**: Docker/Kubernetes requirements
9. **Testing**: Unit, integration, e2e requirements
10. **Observability**: Logging, metrics, monitoring

**Don't memorize** - Check your constitution document every feature.
**Path varies by project** - Ask your team lead for location.

## 💬 Common Prompts (Copy-Paste Ready)

### Research Phase
```
"Analyze the codebase for [feature] and create a pre-implementation document that covers:
- Related existing code
- Files to modify
- Technical decisions needed
- Risks and dependencies"
```

### Start New Feature
```
"I'm starting [STORY-ID]. Read constitution, implementation guide, feature specification.
Perform pre-implementation analysis and identify:
1. Files to create/modify
2. Dependencies
3. Technical decisions needed"
```

### TDD Implementation
```
"Implement [task] following TDD:
1. Write test FIRST at [test file path]
2. Show me test code
3. Run it (should FAIL/RED)
4. Implement code to make it pass
5. Refactor while keeping GREEN"
```

### Code Review (Different Model)
```
"Review this code (generated by [MODEL]):

Constitution: [paste relevant sections]
Spec: [paste acceptance criteria]

Check for:
1. Constitution violations
2. Security issues
3. Performance problems
4. Missing error handling
5. Edge cases not tested"
```

## 🔧 Common Situations & Quick Actions

| Situation | Quick Action |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Bug in production** | Create issue → Write failing test → Fix → PR |
| **Spec unclear** | `/speckit.clarify` → Update spec → Get confirmation |
| **Constitution blocks approach** | Document → Discuss with lead → ADR if needed |
| **AI code looks wrong** | **Trust your instincts** → Check constitution → Different AI review → Ask senior |
| **Speckit down** | Use templates → Manual spec → Senior review before Phase 2 |
| **Tests take too long** | **Don't skip** → Start with critical path → Add edge cases incrementally |
| **Blocked by dependency** | Update issue → Work on parallel tasks → Create mocks for testing |
| **Working after hours** | Check constitution → Use `/speckit.clarify` (async) → Post in team chat → Document blockers |

---

## 🛑 Emergency Stops

**STOP IMMEDIATELY IF:**
- Constitution check fails → Escalate to tech lead
- Can't write test first → Requirements unclear, `/speckit.clarify`
- Security issue found → Fix before proceeding
- Coverage < 80% → Write more tests
- Same AI reviewing its own code → Use different model
- Docker tests fail → Debug before PR

**ESCALATE TO:**
- Tech lead for architecture decisions
- Create ADR if constitution change needed
- Senior developer if stuck > 2 hours

## 🆘 If You're Stuck

**2-minute rule**: Try to solve yourself for 2 minutes
**15-minute rule**: If stuck > 15 min, ask for help
**2-hour rule**: If stuck > 2 hours, escalate to senior/lead

**Where to get help:**
1. Check constitution & implementation guide
2. Ask different AI model for perspective
3. Post in team chat
4. Pair with senior developer
5. Create ADR if architecture question

---

## 🚩 Red Flags (Call for Help)

- Writing code before tests
- Same AI generating + reviewing
- Coverage < 80% "just this once"
- "I'll add tests later"
- Constitution violation "necessary for this feature"
- Skipping Docker testing
- Stuck on same issue > 2 hours

**If you see these in your workflow → PAUSE and get help**

---

## 🎯 Success Metrics (After 5 Features, You Should...)

- Generate specs in < 1 hour
- Write tests before implementation naturally
- Know constitution patterns by memory
- Use different AI for reviews automatically
- Complete features in ~6 hours
